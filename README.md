# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to take turns playing the classic Tic Tac Toe game on the terminal.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend, taking turns on the same computer.
- Simple terminal-based interface: The game is played on the terminal/command prompt.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. The board will be displayed on the terminal, with numbers 1 to 9 representing each cell.
3. Each player takes turns choosing an empty cell by inputting the position number (1-9) where they want to place their symbol.
4. The first player uses 'X' as their symbol, and the second player uses 'O'.
5. The game continues until one player wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the board is filled with no winner (a tie).

## Example Board

-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
-------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

## How to Run

1. Save the Tic Tac Toe Python script to a file, for example, `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command.
4. Run the game by typing: `python tic_tac_toe.py`.

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python is based on simple logic and doesn't include advanced AI for the computer player.

Feel free to modify and expand the game to add more features, such as a graphical interface, an unbeatable AI, or additional player options.
